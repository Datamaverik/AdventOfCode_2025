# Advent of Code 2025 — Java Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository!
This repo contains daily coding challenge solutions implemented using `Java`.
The goal is to write clean, performant algorithms and document approaches for each problem.

## Project Structure

- Each day has its own folder.

- Each part of the puzzle has a separate Java file when useful.


## How to Run

- Ensure `Java 17+` is installed.

#### Compile:
```bash
javac src/DayX/*.java
```

#### Run:
```bash
java src.DayX.Part1
or
java src.DayX.Part2
```

## Goals of the Challenge

- Improve problem-solving

- Practice algorithms & data structures

- Write clean, well-structured Java code

- Document reasoning and approaches

- Learn from mistakes and refactoring

## Tools and Language

#### Language: `Java`

#### IDE: `IntelliJ IDEA`

#### VCS: `Git & GitHub`
